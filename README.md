# WalkerBoard

Like Geckoboard but with <del>less</del> *different* features.

## Widgets

 - Text / Markdown
 - Value / Value plus second stat/text
 - ChartJS chart

@todo

 - Funnel
 - Gauge
 - HighChart (? I had this in the old version...)

## getting started

To try it out go to `https://thechriswalker.github.io/walkerboard`.

You can load a specific `board.json` by passing the url to it in the query string (yay, CORS).

To create your own `board.json`, check out the sample one and see how it works.

## development

`git clone` and `npm install` and `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:8080/dev.html`
